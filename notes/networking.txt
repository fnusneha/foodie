Steps t download fro network anything using httpconnection



When users click the button that invokes myClickHandler(), the app passes the specified URL to the AsyncTask subclass DownloadWebpageTask.
The AsyncTask method doInBackground() calls the downloadUrl() method.
The downloadUrl() method takes a URL string as a parameter and uses it to create a URL object.
The URL object is used to establish an HttpURLConnection.
Once the connection has been established, the HttpURLConnection object fetches the web page content as an InputStream.
The InputStream is passed to the readIt() method, which converts the stream to a string.
Finally, the AsyncTask's onPostExecute() method displays the string in the main activity's UI.
