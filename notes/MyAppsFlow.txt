Ques to ask Lobab--
1>Inspiro uses only outh for facebook and twitter.right?
2>show myNetworking app on your mobile and ask cant we do this with twitter or facebook?
3>Image memory caching and disk caching is acheved by Picaso or some other code is also used.Does picaso handle everything?
4>what to ans if they check Inspiro and find many bugs in it.Like-fb api key not generated.
5>How to ans for the password security i.e  static variable in stamping Salon valenti?
6>Time duration for each app.



Inspiro

1>Action tab and view pager for two contents-WorldView and Favourate using FragmnetstatePagerAdapter.
2>Used Flicker Restfull Api to get popular countries,cities in that and popular images in each city.
3>In World View used ExpandableListview with BaseExpandableListAdapter to Load data.
4>Supporting diffrent orientation,it shows expandable list and favourates tab both in same activity.
5>Using Google Maps,showed markers on the map for all the contries and cities in the list.Clicking on the marker let us see the most popular image for that city.
6>share image through facebook,Twitter,Drive,gmail and skype from your favourates.
7>Clicking on each City there is custom List view that has an image view and two Image buttons(one for adding to favourate and one for sharing via facebook).Clicking on each image shows the larger image.
8>These images have been shown using efficient logic of memory caching and disk caching.
9>Favourate tabs help us to see the favourates added and delete it as well by simply swapping the image right.

<LOGIC FOR MEMORY CACHING AND ALL>

If a user clicks a button to view some image.These things happens-

1>first the image is chked in the heap memory(Memory cache/object is checked )
.If it is there it loads in the image view.
2>if it is not in heap memory,it checks in file storage and if it is not tehre it downloads from internet(done in background) and save in file ad then retrieve from there.Using handler it is posted on the main thread.
3>when it saving in Memory it uses LinkedHashMap,which has 2 kind of ordering--  i m using access ordering.for setting access ordering one paramater has to be true.
private Map<String, Bitmap> cache = Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap<String, Bitmap>(10, 1.5f, true));
All the methods are synchronized.
What likned hash map and access ordering does?
what ever u r putting in the map or getting from it.. it puts in the front.i.e leat recently used things are in the bck.

While putting in this map we ae checking at run time the limit.Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory() / 4);
if the size exceeds after putting we iterate through the map and remove less recently used items till the limit is full.

ImageLoader class uses weak hashMap so that if the entries are eligble for GC it will be able to do.
handler is used to post .Till things are done in async task spinner is displayed showing photo is downloading.
